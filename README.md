# ProcessingNewProject
A simple program which makes a fullscreen processing window.  Good for starting projects.

1. To Start, type into terminal:  
  `git clone https://github.com/RAHS-Computer-Science-Club/ProcessingNewProject.git`
2. Rename the root directory to whatever you like (The project name).  The name you choose is defined by "__RenamedProject__"   
  `mv ProcessingNewProject/ `__`RenamedProject`__`/`
3. Then, cd into it:  
  `cd `__`RenamedProject`__`/`
4. Rename the project in the code
  `sh rename.sh `__`RenamedProject`__`
5. Test, to make sure it compiles:
  `ant build`
6. Now you're all set to make a new project in processing!
